# Simple Mining
This is a very basic, simple plugin for running some basic mining.
We hope to make a more comprehensive mining focused dashboard view
in the future. For now, this is mostly for testing simnet and regtest
environments.

Simply add `'@bpanel/simple-mining'` to your pluginsConfig.js `plugins`
array, and refresh your bPanel!
